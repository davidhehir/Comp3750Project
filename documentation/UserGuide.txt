--------------------

The command line tools are fairly simple to use, requiring only a few parameters each.

ColourCorrelogram:
------------------
This tool takes 3 input parameters:
<Image Directory> <Output Directory> <radius>

Image Directory: A folder of jpg images that the colour correlogram needs to be calculated for.
The tool will recursively search though each file in the folder and calculate the correlogram (i.e. will calculate the correlogram for every file that is not . or .. in the linux file system).

Output Directory: Where to write the serialized json file to. Currently is names MaxFeatureVector.json but can easily be renamed in the code.
Note: The folder must exist before running the tool

Radius: The search radius of the colour correlogram. Must be a whole integer number greater than 0


FeatureMatcher:
---------------
The command line arguments required to use the feature matcher are as follows:
 <Json Input File> <output json folder> <tau value>

 Json Input File: The file produced by the Colour Correlogram Tool. Contains all of the serialized correlogram values for each image
 
 output json folder: the folder location of where the serialized clusters of images names should be written to. Each cluster contains a list of iamges (specified by their file name as specified in the colour correlogram step).
