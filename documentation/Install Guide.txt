Installation Guide:

--------------------
This install guide covers Linux systems only. All of the tools are said to be compatible with Windows, however, the code here has not been tested on a  windows machine.

Prerequisites:
--------------
The following software must be installed prior to building and using
the Colour correlogram and feature matcher tools.

* OpenCV (min tested version 2.3.0)
* Cmake (comes with OpenCV)
* Jansson
* 

Installing OpenCV:
-------------------
A full install guide will not be presented here since it is well documented elsewhere on the internet. A guide I have found useful for installing OpenCV on ubuntu can be found here http://abhitak.wordpress.com/2009/08/29/installing-opencv-on-linux-ubuntu-9-04/

If OpenCV is installed using the above method, CMake will also be automatically installed.

Installing Jansson:
------------------
A full install guide for linux can be found here:

Building Code From Source:
-------------------------
After downloading the source from github, the code needs to be extracted using the following command:
unzip davidhehir-Comp3750-5af7514.zip
This will extract the files into the following file structure:
root
|->ColorCorrelogram
|->FeatureMatcher
|->Playground
|->Comparer
|->python
|->Testfiles

1.Building Colour Correlogram
------------------------------:
Go to the root of the folder ColorCorrelogram and type the following commands:
cmake .
make

If everything was successfully built, there should be an executable in src/ and is called main

2. Building Feature Matcher
---------------------------
At the project root folder type the following commands:
cd FeatureMatcher
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../src/
make

This will build an executable called FeatureMatcher in the build folder.
